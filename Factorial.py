"""
Here is a brief overview of what a factorial is in math. Read through the lesson and then complete the programming assignment below: https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/factorial.html

Write a program that prints out a factorial. N factorial (written N!) is defined as

N * (N-1) * (N-2) * ... * 1
For example, 4! is

4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
Ask the user for the value of N. Use for loops and variables to print out N factorial.

(Hint: You solve factorial by multiplying the numbers from 1 all the way up to N together. You need a variable to store the result.)

for i in range(n):
    m = m * b
    b=b+1
