"""
Write a function that computes the area of a triangle given its base and height.

The formula for an area of a triangle is:

AREA = 1/2 * BASE * HEIGHT
For example, if the base was 5 and the height was 4, the area would be 10.

triangle_area(5, 4); # should print 10
"""
def triangle_area(x,y):
    print ("area = " + str(x*y/2))

triangle_area(10,3)
triangle_area(10,3)
triangle_area(10,3)
